Visualization of voronoi diagrams given random points on a plane.

** Dependencies
- Raylib =< 5.0
- [[https://github.com/longlene/cl-raylib][cl-raylib]]

To build, run the ~./build.lisp~ file using your prefered common lisp implementation. Personally, I prefer using SBCL, but using it from roswell should work too.
